# hello-world
This repository is for experimentation and examples.

It contains the **ISSUE_TEMPLATE_FORM.yaml** file inside the **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE** folder. As a result, the issue tracker uses that template to offer the user a YAML form to fill out.

I've put together a [YAML template cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/Elliria/ee13ed5201aaaac6f77f55290f189f0a) where you can see some examples you can (modify and) use in your templates.
